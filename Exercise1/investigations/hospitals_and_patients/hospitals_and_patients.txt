Justification for Approach:
I started from clean data that was limited to comparable hospitals with data of sufficient quality for the subset of measures that represent procedures that should be included in an average quality of care score. For more details on the assumptions during the cleaning process, please see the 'Architecture Design' document.

From the clean data, I calculated the mean and standard deviation across all hospitals for each procedure. I used this to identify, for a given hospital-procedure score, the number of standard deviations better than the mean for that procedure. This allowed me to standardize the scores by taking into account the level of variance for a given procedure so that hospital level metrics can be aggregated across procedures.

My next step was to take the mean standardized scores and the standard deviations across all procedures for each hospital with data for at least 5 procedures. I then calculated the correlation of these two metrics with the patient survey overall base score.

Results:
corr_hosp_survey_ratings	corr_hosp_variability_survey_rating
0.12510337471219435     -0.05703157100373594

Conclusion:
Hospital quality of care scores are only slightly positively correlated with patient survey overall hospital scores at 0.125. Variability of quality of care scores across procedures for a hospital is slightly negatively correlated with patient survey overall hospital scores as -0.057.
