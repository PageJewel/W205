Justification for Approach:
I started from clean data that was limited to comparable hospitals with data of sufficient quality for the subset of measures that represent procedures that should be included in an average quality of care score. For more details on the assumptions during the cleaning process, please see the 'Architecture Design' document.

From the clean data, I calculated the mean and standard deviation across all hospitals for each procedure. I used this to identify, for a given hospital-procedure score, the number of standard deviations better than the mean for that procedure. This allowed me to standardize the scores by taking into account the level of variance for a given procedure so that state level metrics can be aggregated across procedures.

My next step was to take the mean standardized scores for each state across all hospital-procedures, and then to subtract the standard deviation across all hospital-procedure data points for that state. This metric was used to rank the states on their consistent delivery of high-quality care for all states with at least 25 data points. The mean score represented the average quality of care delivered in the state, and the incorporation of the standard deviation metric took into account the consistency. This way a state with a high average score but a large variability will not be ranked as highly as a state with a slightly lower average score but a much lower variability across procedures.
